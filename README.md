# MindSync Frontend Workspace

- Container: mindsync_frontend
- Framework: React (Create React App)

To run (frontend-only demo, no backend required):
1) cd mindsync_frontend
2) npm install
3) npm start

Notes:
- This workspace has been refactored to a frontend-only demo. No Firebase or API keys are required.
- Authentication is mock-only and stored in localStorage for demo purposes (not secure for production).
